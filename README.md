# odin-recipes
First Odin project, foundations course

My first web page using HTML

 This is a project focus on helping me showcase the skill that
 i have acquired while i have been studying with the odin project curriculum.
 it is meant to help me apply all the knowledge that I now have.
 From learnign how to use the shell and git to how to write html and summit comments.

I have made the mistake of making the page in english and spanish, this happen because i copy the recipe from a page in spanish.
